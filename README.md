# MyAuthApp 1.0.0
Hi guys, I am a newbie learning to build apps. To make my learning more effective I am trying to build a simple user database app with the following functionalities. Who knows, maybe this app can grow into something that people can use. Please help. I would appreciate if you guys can help me out with my issues while guiding me through this project. Thank you very much in advance.
1. Login View: Signup with email and password or signup with Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.
2. Me View: User Account setup: The app pulls the user's Facebook public profile or asks to fill in a form with basic info such as in Facebook public profile.
3. Me View: User Account setup: User is asked to make a couple of inputs (favorite books, favorite movies, etc). Each input should have a title, description and an image.
4. Search View: Search the database by various user inputs by applying a couple of filters.
5. Search View: The view displays the results in a small list card format with small avatars in some kind of an order (most relevant first).
6. Search View: User clicks on listed result of users and opens the users profile (perhaps in a similar format as his/her own user profile)
